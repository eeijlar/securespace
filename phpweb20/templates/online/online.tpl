		<p>Online counselling has much in common with face-to-face counselling, except that you can engage in counselling at your own pace, in your own time by working with your counsellor online through writing.  Usually, online counselling doesn't take place in 'real time' and you and your counsellor post replies to each other over a period of time.  E-mail is not secure for online counselling that is why we use Secure Space a fully 128 bit encrypted environment, that provides water tight secure for confidential communications.</p>

<p>Many clients find that the extra degree of anonymity offered by online counselling is a real benefit.  As a client, you will be listened to non-judgmentally. Your counsellor will make every effort to understand things from your point of view, will be honest with you, and if at any time you have a question about the process of counselling, you will be able to ask.</p>

Description: Block IP Addresses based on login or access failure
        information in system logs.
        
        Updates a hosts blockfile (such as hosts.allow) automatically,
        to block IP addresses. Will also expire previously blocked addresses
        based on age of last failed login attempt, this keeps the blockfile
        size manageable.
        In addition to TCP_WRAPPERS, can also execute iptables or ip route commands
        to block all TCP/IP network input from an IP address, so all services, even
        those that do not run under libwrap TCP_WRAPPERS, can be protected.
        
        Facilities for whitelists and blacklists, and email notification on major
        events are also available.

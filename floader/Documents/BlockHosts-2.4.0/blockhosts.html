<pre>
version:     2.4.0

Usage: blockhosts.py [options]

Block IP Addresses based on login or access failure information in system
logs.  Updates a hosts blockfile (such as hosts.allow) automatically, to block
IP addresses. Will also expire previously blocked addresses based on age of
last failed login attempt, this keeps the blockfile size manageable. In
addition to TCP_WRAPPERS, can also execute iptables or ip route commands to
block all TCP/IP network input from an IP address, so all services, even those
that do not run under libwrap TCP_WRAPPERS, can be protected.  Facilities for
whitelists and blacklists, and email notification on major events are also
available.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --configfile=FILE     Name of configuration file to read. A configuration
                        file must exist, blockhosts cannot run without a
                        configuration file. (/etc/blockhosts.cfg)

  Common options:
    Each option is shown below with its current value in parentheses ().
    Nearly all of these options can be specified in the configuration
    file, and that is the recommended way.

    -q, --quiet         Be as quiet as possible - only print out error
                        messages
    -v, --verbose       Be verbose - print errors, warnings, and info messages
    -g, --debug         Be chatty - print out debug level messages also
    --dry-run           Don't write the block file or send email or block
                        routes, just print out blockhosts section of output
                        block file file to stdout instead (False)
    --echo=TAG          Prints TAG on stderr and syslog, may be used to
                        identify a run of this script ()
    --blockfile=FILE    Name of hosts-block-file to read/write
                        (/etc/hosts.allow)

  BlockHosts blockfile specific options:
    These options apply to the process of updating the list of blocked
    hosts in the blockfile. Note that all of these options can be
    specified in the config file instead of the command-line.

    --load-only         Load the blockfile, the blocked/watched host list, but
                        do not prune/add or write back the data (False)
    --ignore-offset     Ignore last-processed offset, start processing from
                        beginning.  This is useful for testing or special uses
                        only. (False)
    --logfiles=FILE1,FILE2,...
                        The names of log files to parse ("/var/log/secure")
    --lockfile=FILE     Prevent multiple instances from writing to blockfile
                        at once - open this file for locking and writing
                        (/tmp/blockhosts.lock)
    --enable-rules=REGEX
                        A regular expression to match names of rules that are
                        to be enabled. Rule names are defined in the
                        blockhosts config file. '.*' will enable all patterns.
                        ('(sshd|.*ftpd).*')

  Blocking and watching IP lists filtering:
    These options apply to the pruning and updating of the blocked and
    watched lists of IP addresses.

    --blockcount=COUNT  Number of invalid tries allowed, before blocking host
                        (7).  Integer values only.
    --discard=AGE       Number of hours after which to discard record - if
                        most recent invalid attempt from IP address is older,
                        discard that host entry (12).  Integer values only.
    --whitelist=IP1,IP2,...
                        A list of IP (IPv4) addresses or regular expressions
                        that represent a IP. When considering IPs to block, if
                        that IP address matches any item in this list, then it
                        will be rejected for the block list - never blocked.
                        ('127.0.0.1')
    --blacklist=IP1,IP2,...
                        When considering IPs to block, if that IP address
                        matches any item in this list, then it will be
                        immediately added to the block list, even if
                        blockcount/COUNT_THRESHOLD may not have been reached.
                        IP addresses directly specified in this list without
                        using a regular expression will be immediately added
                        to the blocked list.  The whitelist takes precedence
                        over blacklist - so a match in both will mean it is
                        white-listed. ('')

  Mail specific options:
    These options apply to the process of sending email.

    --mail              Enable e-mail capability - send message with list of
                        newly blocked or expired hosts, if any. Email is sent
                        only if there are error/warning/notice messages in the
                        log output. (False)
    --check-ip=IPADDRESS
                        DEPRECATED. Instead of always mailing entire list of
                        blocked address, just send email if given IP address
                        is being blocked (). DEPRECATED - this is no longer
                        useful since --mail will automatically send email only
                        on errors/warnings/notices, and the notice level
                        includes newly blocked or expired addresses.
    --notify-address=ADDRESS
                        Address to send notification emails to
                        (root@localhost.localdomain)

  TCP/IP level blocking options:
    These options apply to the process of using ip route/iptables commands
    to block IP addresses. Root permission for the run of this script is
    needed, since only root can change routing tables or install iptables
    rules. [This works fine if using hosts.access/hosts.deny to run this
    script.] All communication to the IP address is blocked at route or
    packet, therefore, this method of disabling a host will protect even
    non-tcpwrapper services.

    --ipblock=IP-COMMAND
                        Enable IP address block capability, using "iptables"
                        or "ip route" command. All communication to the IP
                        address is blocked using packet filtering. Use
                        --ipblock=iptables or --ipblock="ip route", as needed.
                        Full path can also be provided, e.g.
                        --ipblock=/sbin/iptables or --ipblock="/sbin/ip route"
                        ()

<h3>DETAILS</h3>

<pre>
    Automatic updates to hosts.allow to block IP addresses based on failed
    login accesses for ssh/ftp or any such service.
    
    Script to record how many times "sshd" or other service is being attacked,
    and when a particular IP address exceeds a configured number of
    failed login attempts, that IP address is added to /etc/hosts.allow with
    the deny flag to prohibit access.
    Script uses /etc/hosts.allow to store (in comments) count
    of failed attempts, and date of last attempt for each IP address
    By default, hosts.allow is used, but program can be configured to use any
    other file, including /etc/hosts.deny, as needed.
    IP addresses with expired last attempt dates (configurable)
    can be removed, to keep /etc/hosts.allow size manageable.
    This script can be run as the optional command in /etc/hosts.allow
    itself, so will kick off only when someone connects to a specific service
    controlled by tcpwrappers, or use cron to periodically run this script.
    
    TCP_WRAPPERS should be enabled for all services, which allows use of
    hosts.allow file.
    hosts_options should also have been enabled, which requires compile time
    PROCESS_OPTIONS to be turned on. This allows extensions to the
    basic hosts.* file line format.  The extensible language supports lines
    of this format in /etc/hosts.allow:
        daemon_list : client_list : option : option ...
    See the man pages for hosts_options and hosts_access(5) for more
    information.
    
    
    Null Routing and Packet Filtering Blocking
    Many services do not use libwrap, so cannot use TCP_WRAPPERS blocking
    methods. Those services can be protected by this script, by using
    the null routing, or iptables packet filtering to completely block all
    network communication from a particular IP address.
    Use the --ipblock=<how> option to enable null routing or packet filtering
    blocking.
    Root permission for the run of blockhosts.py script is needed, since
    only root can change routing tables or install iptables rules. This works
    fine if using hosts.access/hosts.deny to run this script.
    Null routing/packet filtering could be used for example, to scan Apache
    web server logs, and based on that, block an IP address so neither
    Apache or any other service on the computer will see any network
    communication that IP address.
    
    Mail Notification Support
    Email notifications can be sent periodically using a cron script, or
    email can be sent provided a a given IP address is being blocked by
    blockhosts. Such email notifications include all currently blocked
    IP addresses in the email message. Will not send email if given IP address
    is not yet blocked, or if not a single address is being blocked. SMTP is
    required for sending email.
    
    Whitelist and Blacklist Support
    Lists can be specified to force particular IP addresses to be
    never blocked (whitelist), or to be immediately blocked (blacklist).
    The lists contain IP addresses or regular expressions representing IP
    addresses. This built-in method of whitelist and blacklist provides
    an easy way to make sure IPs are blocked or never-blocked whatever the
    configuration of blockhosts.py - using cron or hosts.allow invocation, or
    using hosts.allow or iptables or route command blocking.
    
    Example hosts.allow script:
    Warnings:
    * Be sure to keep a backup of your initial hosts.allow (or hosts.deny)
      file, in case it gets overwritten due to an error in this script.
    * Do read up on the web topics related to security, denial-of-service,
      and IP-address spoofing.
      Visit the blockhosts home page for references.
    * This script handles IPv4 addresses only.
    
    Usage:
    For more info, run this program with --help option.
    
    The blockfile (hosts.allow, or if needed, hosts.deny) layout needs to
    have a certain format:
      Add following sections, in this order:
      -- permament whitelist and blacklist of IP addresses using hosts.allow syntax
      -- blockhosts marker lines - two lines
      -- execute command to kick off blockhosts.py on connects to services
    
    See "man 5 hosts_access" and "man hosts_options" for more details on
    hosts.* files line formats.
    
    The two HOSTS_MARKER_LINEs define a section, this is the
    region where blockhosts will read/write IP blocking data in the
    hosts.allow file. It will use comments to store bookkeeping data needed
    by this script in that section, too.
    Lines before and after the two HOST_MARKER_LINEs will be left unchanged
    in the hosts.allow file
    
    See the "INSTALL" file in the blockhosts.py source package for a
    detailed example of the hosts.allow file.
    
    ====
    Requirements:
        1: Python 2.3 or later, need the optparse module.
    
        2: Primarily uses host control facility and related files such as
           hosts.access. If not using TCP/IP blocking, then the extensions to
           the access control language as described in the man 5 hosts_options
           page are required, which allow use of :allow and :deny keywords.
           ["...extensions  are  turned  on  at program build time by
           building with -DPROCESS_OPTIONS..."]
    
        3: If not using host control facilities (tcpd, hosts.access, etc),
           then there needs to be a way to trigger the run of blockhosts.py,
           or blockhosts.py should be run periodically using cron. Secondly,
           there must be some way to update a file to list the blocked ip
           (for example, hosts.deny file, or Apache .htaccess file, etc).
           Alternately, all TCP/IP communication can be blocked by using the
           null-routing or packet filtering options of blockhosts.py

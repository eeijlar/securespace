<h3>Online Counselling</h3>

<p>
We offer secure online counselling and therapy from qualified professionals trained in online techniques, with a variety of specialisations. Requesting counselling is as simple as purchasing credits from this site using a credit card.  An account for the Secure Space system is automatically created with access only available to counsellor and client - a simple, private web page which anyone can learn to use within minutes.  A session comprises one hour the counsellor's time working online with the client. Individual counsellors may discuss their own guidelines with clients as to what they can expect for a session. Unlimited messages may be posted to the Secure Space session by client and counsellor.  For more information please see the What is Online Counselling page.

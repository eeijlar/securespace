               You are seeing this page because you don't have your digital certificate installed. </p>

In order to get your digital certificate your therapist has to review your application. When they accept your application you should receive an e-mail with your digital certificate attached. You should also receive a text message with the password to your digital certificate.

The registration process is as follows:
<ul>
<li> After you complete the registration page you will receive an e-mail with your user name and password to use the service.</li>

<li> Your therapist accepts your application. When they do, you will receive another e-mail with your digital certificate attached. You will also receive a text message with the password to your digital certificate.</li>

<h3><span class="backgroundGrey">Why do I have to do all this?</span></h3>
<p>
Your security as a client is our top priority. In order for us to be sure that users of the service are who they say they are; we use digital certificates to validate all users of the service. This method of verifying user access is similar to the security model used by banks and other high security institutions. 
</p>
<p>
This makes registration a little bit more complicated but once it's done, it's very straightforward to use the service, and you benefit from the extra security features employed by the site. Counselling web sites which offer this level of security are quite rare. At the time of writing this is possibly the only onein existence.
